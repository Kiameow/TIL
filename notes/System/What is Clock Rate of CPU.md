You might notice one of the specifications of your CPU -- the clock rate(or clock speed), and what
that means? and it determines what?

Okay, the clock rate means how many complete motions are done in one sec, like the 3.2GHz tells the
CPU can switch on and off 3.2 billion times in one sec, and abstractly speaking, the CPU does these
switches for executing commands, so the clock rate is a useful feature for you to judge a CPU's
capability. 

But please pay attention, a higher clock rate doesn't always mean greater performance, as
different CPUs can have different architectures. That can be convincing proof only when you compare
two CPUs that have the same brand and generation info. You know, frequency matters, and so does
proficiency.

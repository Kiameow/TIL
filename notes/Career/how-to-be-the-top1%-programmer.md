### 1. One PR a Day
one PR a day means making micro progress continuously, and record it. In that way, you will know
clearly that you are up-rising, gaining energy and motivation. And with recording everything in
small period, it's easier for your collegues to give you feedback, how to change your code, etc.

### 2. Problem Solving Mindset
Don't just do the things your boss assigned to you, instead, you gotta make conversation with
your PM, the feature, the time trade-off, anything that affects the final product. You need to
get yourself involve in the whole building process, and give your opinion, reaching a consensus
is always the cornerstone.

### 3. Let Your Manager Work for You
When you have a career goal, talk to your manager. You gotta know the meaning of the presence of your manager -- to help you get your work done, more precisely, get your promotion. The manager, they know how things work in the company, so if you send signal to your manager, they will keep an eye on you, like giving you feedback about your work to help you reach some standard in your company or assign you more ownership of one project. Of course, your manager won't push you when you say nothing, you know, everyone got their own life style. But if you said, then things might change.
